# stdinprinter

This is just some small debug application that I use a lot for my editor, [exquisite](pfirsich/exquisite). It prints whatever you enter in your terminal (primarily interesting for escape sequences and such).

It's on here, so I can send it around and ask people what their terminal emulator emits for certain inputs.
